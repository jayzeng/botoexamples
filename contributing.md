So you've got an awesome idea to throw into botoexamples. Awesome!

Workflow
--------
Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

* Fork the project.
* Clone down your fork ( `git clone git@github.com:<username>/botoexamples.git` ).
* Create a topic branch to contain your change ( `git checkout -b my_awesome_example` ).
* Hack away, add docs/code snippet. Not necessarily in that order.
* Make sure everything still passes by running `make test`.
* If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
* Push the branch up ( `git push origin my_awesome_example` ).
* Create a pull request against jayzeng/botoexamples and describe what your change
  does and the why you think it should be merged.

Thanks! Hacking on boto should be fun. We make this project that aims to improve the boto
quality and help other developers pick up boto.
